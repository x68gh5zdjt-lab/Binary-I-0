Blah blah blah im the dudeman


Now, this is a story all about how
My life got flipped, turned upside down
And I'd like to take a minute
Just sit right there
I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel Air
In west Philadelphia born and raised
On the playground is where I spent most of my days
Chillin’ out, maxin’, relaxin’ all cool
And all shooting some b-ball outside of the school
When a couple of guys who were up to no good
Started making trouble in my neighborhood
I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
She said 'You're moving with your auntie and uncle in Bel Air'
I whistled for a cab and when it came near
The license plate said ‘fresh’ and it had dice in the mirror
If anything I could say that this cab was rare
But I thought 'Nah, forget it' - 'Yo home, to Bel Air'
I pulled up to the house about 6 or 7
And I yelled to the cabbie 'Yo home, smell you later'
I looked at my kingdom
I was finally there
To sit on my throne as the Prince of Bel Air
